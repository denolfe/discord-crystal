# This middleware immediately calls the next middleware in the chain, and if

# middleware allowing the user to trigger additional handling. Such as,

# extra logging at the time of exception.

# It can be initialized with a string that will be used as a canned response.
# The text "%exception%" will be replaced with the exception's message if
# provided. Alternatively, it can be initialized with a block for any other
# custom behavior.
